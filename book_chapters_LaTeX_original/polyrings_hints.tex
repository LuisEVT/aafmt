\section{Hints for ``Polynomial Rings'' exercises}\label{sec:polyrings:hints} 

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:poly:polySum1}(d):  Note $4=3+1$ and $11=3^2+2$.

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:poly:multform}(d): Are there any common factors you can take outside 
the summations before multiplying?

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:poly:orders}:  Consider $g_i, g_i^2, g_i^3, \ldots, g_i^{p_i-1}$ and use exponent rules to show that they are not equal to $e$.  Similarly, show that $g_i^{p_i} = e$.
