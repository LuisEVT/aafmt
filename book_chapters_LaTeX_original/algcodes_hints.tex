\section{Hints for ``Error Detecting and Correcting Codes'' exercises}\label{sec:algcodes:hints} 


Exercise \ref{exercise:algcodes:hamming}(c): Apply part (b) to both sides of the equation, and show they are equal.


\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:algcodes:ctns0}(a): Add any codeword to itself.

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:algcodes:code_dsn}(c): Use the  paragraph just above this exercise.

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:algcodes:lincode0}: Show that the codewords in $C$ that have $i$'th coordinate equal to 0 form a subgroup of $C$, and consider the cosets of this subgroup in $C$.

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:algcodes:linlin}:  What row should you add to the parity check matrix?

\noindent Exercise \ref{exercise:algcodes:lineven}:  Use the previous exercise to show the codewords of even weight in $C$ form a subgroup. Then consider the cosets of this subgroup in $C$.
