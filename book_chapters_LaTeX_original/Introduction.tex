\section*{To the student:}
\medskip

Many students start out liking math. Some like it well enough that they even want to teach it. However, when they reach advanced math classes (such as abstract algebra), they become bewildered and frustrated. Their textbooks talk about strange mathematical thingamabobs they've never heard of, which have nonsensical properties that come from who knows where. In lectures, the professor/oracle  makes pronouncements (a.k.a ``theorems'') and utters long incantations (a.k.a ``proofs'') , but it's hard to see the point of either.

If the above paragraph describes you, then this book is meant for you!

There's a good reason why higher math classes are bewildering for most students. I believe that we math instructors tend to take too much for granted.\footnote{My father always says that trying to understand math is frustrating, but once you've got it it's even more frustrating to try to explain it to others.} It's easy to forget that we're only able to understand abstractions because we have concrete examples that we keep referring back to, consciously or subconsciously. These examples enable us to fit new abstract ideas in with specific behaviors and patterns that we're very familiar with. But students who don't have a firm hold on the examples have nothing to hold on to, and are left grasping (and gasping) for air. 

To be sure, most students have previously been exposed to various important examples that historically gave rise to abstract algebra. These examples include the complex numbers, integers mod $n$, symmetries, and so on. They can give definitions and do some basic computations according to the rules. But they haven't been given a chance to internalize these examples.  They can kind of follow along, but they aren't ``fluent".

Our hope is that after reading this book students will be able to say, ``I've seen complex numbers, integers mod $n$ and permutations before, but now I understand what makes them tick. I can see they have  deep underlying similarities, which they share with other mathematical structures.'' 

This is actually a very good time to be learning abstract algebra. Abstract algebra hs moved from the outer boondocks inhabited by specialists and puzzle enthusiasts out  into the center stage of modern  science and technology. Two areas where abstract algebra has made strong contributions stand out particularly: information processing and physics. Coding of information is at the heart of information technology, and abstract algebra provides all of the methods of choice for information coding that is both reliable (impervious to errors) and private.  
On the other hand,  many if not most of the great advances in  physics in the past 100 years are due to deeper understanding of physical symmetries and the groups that produce them (the Lorentz group in special relativity is just one example). We try as much as possible to make connections with these two areas, and hope to do so increasingly in future editions. 

We hope you enjoy the book. Send us your comments!

\section*{To the instructor}

This book  is not intended for budding mathematicians. It was created for a math program in which most of the students in upper-level math classes are planning to become secondary school teachers. For such students, conventional abstract algebra texts are practically  incomprehensible, both in style and in content. Faced with this situation, we decided to create a book that our students could actually read for themselves. In this way we have been able to dedicate class time to problem-solving and personal  interaction rather than rehashing the same material in lecture format.

Admittedly it falls short of the typical syllabus for an upper-level abstract algebra class. But what's the point of covering the syllabus, if the students don't retain anything?  The unhappy fact is that many students at this level haven't yet mastered the important basic examples (complex numbers, etc.) that provide motivation, so it's unrealistic to expect them to grasp abstractions if they don't even understand what's being abstractified.So instead we have dived deeply into basic examples--and these are the just the basic examples that will be most useful to those who go on to a career in high school teaching.

The book is highly modular, and chapters may be readily omitted if students are already familiar with the material. Some chapters  (``Preliminaries'' and ``Sigma Notation'') are remedial. Other chapters cover topics that are often covered in courses in discrete mathematics, such as sets, functions, and equivalence classes. (Much of this material is taken from the Morris' book, with some amplifications.) We have found from experience that students need this re-exposure in order to gain the necessary facility with these concepts, on which so much of the rest of the book is based.

Whenever possible we have introduced applications, which may be omitted at the instructor's discretion. However, we feel that it is critically important for preparing secondary teachers to be familiar with these applications. They will remember these long after they have forgotten proofs they have learned, and they may even be able to convey some of these ideas to their own students.

\emph{Acknowledgements}
\smallskip

In our preparation of this text, we were fortunate to find via the web  some extraordinarily generous authors (Tom Judson, Dave Witte Morris and Joy Morris, A. J. Hildebrand) who freely shared their material with us. Thanks to them, we were able to put the first version of this  textbook together within the span of a single semester (not that we're finished -- this is a living book, not a dead volume). We hope that other instructors will similarly benefit from the material offered here.  

Several Master's students at Texas A\&M-Central Texas have made contributions to the book as part of a projects course or thesis. Their names are listed in the title, and their contributions are acknowleged at the beginning of each chapter. 

Our very special thanks to Meghan DeWitt for her thorough critical reading of the book and her incisive comments. The book has greatly benefitted from her numerous suggestions.
