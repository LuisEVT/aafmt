For questions about the LaTeX please email Chris Thron at thron@tamuct.edu. For any bugs please submit an issue. 

The file LaTeXtoLaTeX-master contains python scripts written by David Farmer to convert the original LaTeX code to 
a structured LaTeX format. The output is used in a coversion to HTML for an online version of the textbook.

To covert using LaTeXtoLaTex, make sure you have an appropriate version of python downloaded. If not you can download it
here: www.python.org. To run the script you will open up a terminal or command prompt and type the follwoing:
ltol.py inputfile otuputfile to convert one file at a time or 
ltol.py inputdirectory outputdirectory to convert the contents of an entire directory. 
If converting a directory, outputdirectory must already exist for the conversion to work.
