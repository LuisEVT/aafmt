      Cryptography is the study of sending and receiving secret messages.
      The aim of cryptography is to send messages across a channel so only the intended recipient of the message can read it.
      In addition, when a message is received,
      the recipient usually requires some assurance that the message is authentic;
      that is, that it has not been sent by someone who is trying to deceive the recipient.
      Modern cryptography is heavily dependent on abstract algebra and number theory.

      <em>Prerequisites</em>: The cryptographic systems we'll be looking at are all based on modular arithmetic.
      To understand this chapter,
      the reader should be familiar with the material in <xref ref="modular">Chapters</xref>
      and <xref ref="functions"></xref>.
      <xref ref="subsec_polyCodes">Section</xref>
      also uses some simple matrix multiplication.
