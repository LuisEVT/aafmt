  <title>Polynomials</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter we'll be looking at polynomials from an algebraic point of view.
      First we'll review basic polynomial arithmetic that you've seen in high school;
      then we'll jump off from there and see how far we can generalize.
      We'll look at polynomial long division,
      and show that there are many striking resemblances with integer division.
      Finally, we'll say something about factoring of polynomials.
