  <title>Set Theory</title>

      <q>A set is a Many that allows itself to be thought of as a One.</q>

      <q>Set</q>
      is one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics,
      and sets have been a part of mathematics since ancient times.
      However, a truly rigorous theory of sets was only developed about a hundred years ago.
      We won't get into the difficulties involved in coming up with a rigorous theory
      (we'll just mention
      <q>Russell's paradox</q>
      in passing).
      Instead, we'll focus on the algebraic properties of sets:
      in particular the operations of intersection, union,
      and complement, and proving identities involving these operations.
