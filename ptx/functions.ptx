  <title>Functions: Basic Concepts</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The idea of a function should be familiar to you from previous math classes.
      Your calculus class no doubt was all about functions defined on real numbers.
      In this book,
      we will be more interested in functions on <em>finite</em> sets.
      Rather than
      <q>doing things</q>
      to these functions
      (such as integrating and differentiating),
      instead we will dig more deeply into the basic nature of functions themselves.
      This will eventually lead us to discover profound connections between groups and functions
      (see the Permutations chapter).

      This chapter is an adapted and expanded version of a chapter by D. and J. Morris.
