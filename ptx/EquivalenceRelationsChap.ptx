  <title>Equivalence Relations and Equivalence Classes</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous chapter we introduced the abstract concept of <em>group</em>,
      which was defined in terms of properties that we'd seen in many previous examples.
      We may say that
      <q>group</q>
      is a generalization which includes many Generalizations like this play a key role in mathematics:
      if we can prove that a particular mathematical structure is a group,
      then all of the general group properties must also be true for that particular structure.
      In this way,
      we learn a great deal about the structure with very little effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter we introduce another generalization:
      the idea of a mathematical <em>relation</em>,
      which generalizes the concept of function as formally defined in <xref ref="functionDef">Definition</xref>.
      We explore various types of relations and their properties,
      and use these new ideas to envision modular arithmetic from a different perspective.
      The new concepts that we introduce in this chapter are foundational to the notions of <em>coset</em>
      and <em>conjugacy class</em>,
      two key group-theoretic structures which play central roles in group theory
      (as we shall see in subsequent chapters).

      This chapter is based on material by D. and J. Morris,
      which was extensively revised and expanded by Mark Leech.
